        Bob's Car Rental was founded in 1976 in Oakville, Ontario by a young entrepreneur
fresh out of Harvard Business School. Since opening his first shop, Bob Stevenson’s company
has expanded to over 50 locations in Ontario. What separates Bob’s Car Rental from other car
rental businesses is their excellent customer service. Bob’s Car Rental employees are required to
smile when dealing with customers, and refer to all customers as either “sir” or “ma’am”, to
make the customers feel properly respected in the store. This has been the secret to Bob
Stevenson's successful business model.
